# Project
I ended up not using the code that was created in class. 
One of the reasons was that the data from console.log only went to the console and couldn't be used elsewhere,
like generating an image on the actual site. 
I tried using a uri from the data to display the image through a function and onclick but it only returned the alt img. 

I tried a different approach where the fetch command is now in function instead of just being called when the tab is open.
This allowed me to store more data for some reason and generate the image when the button called the function.

There are still some errors while fetching the image but this could possibly be from certain cards of magic's history where the cards were
deemed or targeted towards specific groups and the image can't be displayed without the permission of the user. 
Example: https://scryfall.com/card/leg/62/invoke-prejudice

What is really confusing for me was that the console displays an error 503 but still gets data for the console.log and the image.
